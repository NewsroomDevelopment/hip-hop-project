What transpired that night has been widely cited as a pinnacle moment in the history of hip-hop. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> There, Kool Herc, along with a number of hip-hop’s very first emcees, introduced some of the earliest styles of breakbeat DJing, record-scratching, and rhythmic rhyming that would come to characterize hip-hop music for years to come. Less than a decade later, “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0FWhGmPVxLI6jOVF0wjALa?si=jQiAswczTpCzQmMlrKw_Hw">Rapper’s Delight</a>” by New Jersey rap trio the Sugarhill Gang reached the Billboard Hot 100’s Top 40, sending shockwaves through the music industry and beginning the slow but steady rise of hip-hop’s prominence in the wider—and whiter—American consciousness. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The future of hip-hop was bright from then on. The 1980s would prove hip-hop’s mettle in cultural crossover appeal, most notably through punk rock band Blondie’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9An5OcdE4">Rapture</a>” and the <a href="https://youtu.be/4B_UYYPb-Gk?t=94">barrier-breaking</a> collaboration between Run-DMC and Aerosmith in “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6qUEOWqOzu1rLPUPQ1ECpx?si=H2hsQs4FTMaCgArpO3ZSMw">Walk This Way</a>.” The ’90s would usher in the golden age of the genre, birthing legends such as Tupac Shakur, Biggie Smalls, Lauryn Hill, and Outkast onto the American music scene and showcasing the variety, ingenuity, and persistence of a genre and a people with something to say for themselves. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> By the 2000s, hip-hop’s dominance as an art form was undeniable. The decade saw an even wider array of mainstream rappers and the beginnings of some of today’s most well-recognized artists, from Lil Wayne to Drake to Nicki Minaj to Kendrick Lamar. The 2010s would see even more innovation and mainstream acceptance, culminating in Lamar’s 2018 Pulitzer Prize for his groundbreaking album “DAMN.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> All of this success stemmed from the musical innovations of New York City’s Black youth and a small back-to-school party in a Bronx housing project—only a train and a bus ride away from Columbia’s campus. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The growth of hip-hop, from underground party music to a bona fide art form, speaks largely to the persistence and the ingenuity of Black youth from the Bronx. The genre’s climb into the mainstream was a slow and punishing one. Its emergence was marred by relatively little media coverage, a racialized disregard for the music coming out of the ghettos at the height of the crack epidemic, and even <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1990-05-14-9001080277-story.html">attempts at censorship</a> by the U.S. government. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> However, while hip-hop was comparatively left out of mainstream music outlets like KISS-FM, it was consistently buoyed by the American youth; Black youth across the country continued to innovate the sound despite setback after setback. Meanwhile, young people of all backgrounds drove the demand that would eventually translate into label creations, record deals, and increased media coverage for hip-hop artists. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Columbia University, with its historical ties to the larger hip-hop community in New York City, witnessed this phenomenon vividly. Even as both hip-hop and Columbia’s music culture evolved, Columbia would serve as an example of the tenuous relationship between the hip-hop community and American culture. From underground outliers to dominating force to studied art form, this is hip-hop’s story at Columbia. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> _____ </p> <p class="g-body subhed">The 1980s to the 1990s: WKCR, CTV, and the embrace of underground hip-hop</p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Though student-led underground music organizations like <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/eye-lead/2018/10/31/notes-from-the-underground/">Hi-Fi Snock Uptown, Rare Candy, and the Bacchanal committee</a> have steadily raised their profiles, their success in opening student ears to different sounds is relatively recent. Since as far back as the 1980s, the Columbia community’s musical sensibilities have steered away from the progressive and toward the comfortable. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Alumni like Jonathan Gill, CC ’86, and Ovid Santoro, GS ’86, noted that while the rest of the city was delving into new and unexplored sounds in its underground clubs, the music scene on campus was decidedly restrained. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It was basically a lot of white kids who liked things the way they’d always had them … and didn’t really have the inclination to go search for new stuff,” Santoro said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “They were [into] the stuff that was on the radio,” Gill added. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Hip-hop was the newest thing to hit the wider New York music scene since punk rock developed around Lower Manhattan. Before hip-hop pioneers got their music on Columbia’s campus, they had explored the five boroughs, stopping to spin records at small venues like the Police Athletic League and bigger nightclubs like Disco Fever, Danceteria, and the Roxy. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Though the early DJs entered New York’s wider music scene relatively easily and introduced those crowds to the burgeoning music of the Bronx, getting radio play and TV screen time was a challenge. Radio hosts either did not appreciate hip-hop or had a disregard for it, and the first music television channel, MTV, was only created in 1981. It wasn’t until 1985 that Run-DMC would get the first hip hop music video aired on MTV. However, early hip-hop artists were resourceful—after all, they were some of the same people who would reroute electricity from street lights to power their DJ equipment outdoors for block parties. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Meanwhile, the reach of college radio was sitting, relatively untapped, on Columbia’s campus. Two broadcasting clubs—WKCR and Columbia Television—pushed for a greater presence of hip-hop on campus; it was these organizations that hungered for music outside of the radio mainstream. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Santoro was one of the first Columbia students to develop relationships through WKCR with the early rappers of the 1980s. Immediately upon arriving in the city, Santoro was enamored with New York’s underground music scene; he enrolled at Columbia in the summer of 1983 and by September he was interning under WKCR’s new music director Brooke Wentz, BC ’82, Business ’88. Santoro quickly assumed the role of publicity director while hosting his own show during the station’s “Transfigured Night” time slot. The two of them, along with the 1984 station manager Julie Grau, BC ’85; her successor, Gill; and Columbia concert organizer and WKCR DJ Jim Lynch, CC ’85, were among those helping promote hip-hop and other “outlier” music genres during the ’80s. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Then, as now, we [at WKCR] were interested in playing things that weren’t going to get airplay. And hip-hop music had no place on the radio [back then],” Gill explained. “Columbia ended up funding the hip-hop revolution, basically not really knowing what was going on.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Santoro hosted “Transfigured Night,” on Thursdays from 1 to 4 a.m. Between these hours, he and his friends at the station, including Gill, felt free to play what they wanted. Using a technique called “simultaneous broadcasting,” in which a DJ could play multiple records at a time and splice them together, they would mash up different types of music with each other, including hip-hop records. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Particularly between 1983 and 1985, Santoro and Gill began to spin hip-hop records with more frequency. Santoro would get breakbeat records from small music shops in Harlem; some of his favorite artists included the Treacherous Three and the Fearless Four. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I loved those records, because they had such beautiful beats,” Santoro recalled. “Then I’d play other shit over it like William Burroughs… Very few people were playing that on the radio.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Around the same time, Santoro, Gill, and Lynch were active in Columbia’s student-run TV station. On the third floor of Lerner Hall and above WKCR, Columbia Television (CTV) began its operation in 1983, at a time when cable television was still in its relative infancy. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> At the time, video content was sparse for small cable companies like Warner Cable (now Time Warner Cable), which turned to community-created shows to support their business. The environment was ripe for enterprising students to develop Columbia-related shows. Using equipment donated by alumni at the Journalism School—many of whom worked for ABC, NBC, and CBS—students like Santoro, Gill, and Lynch were able to develop their own programming and air it locally. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “We had a Thursday night [slot] from 9 to 10 p.m. on Manhattan Cable TV [called ‘Alternate Currents’],” Santoro recalled. “I had to go up… by Baker Field to their head and deliver my tapes every week. And I’d bring up the master tape and they’d play it and then they’d replay it because they just didn’t have enough programming.” </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/FGJ33BUJONBV7JWCNP2P7KRHUM.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text right"> Cohen and Run-DMC in the CTV studio. <span class="image-credit"> <br> Photo by Lori Traikos / Courtesy of Ovid Santoro </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Between “Transfigured Night” and “Alternate Currents,” Santoro, Gill, and Lynch had hours of potential broadcast time at their disposal. Fortunately, Santoro was not just spinning hip-hop records—he was also meeting hip-hop artists. Santoro traversed New York City’s nightlife, cycling between uptown’s Disco Fever and downtown’s Roxy and Danceteria. It was through these explorations of the city that he met some of the original pioneers of hip-hop: Grandmaster Caz and Jerry D. Lewis of the Cold Crush Brothers. Even before Santoro met Caz, Caz was familiar with Columbia’s campus; his father worked for the University from 1970 to 1972 at the Poinciana, an apartment building on 120th and Amsterdam. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “[Columbia’s campus] was like my playground when I was young,” Caz recalled. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Santoro’s other collaborators included Lyor Cohen, an artist manager at Rush Productions at the time, whom Santoro had met at the University of Miami in 1978, and Run-DMC, whom Cohen managed during the mid 1980s. Santoro and Lynch would bring them, along with the Cold Crush Brothers, to the studio to hang out, spin records, and rehearse. These groups were aired on “Alternate Currents” alongside the Fearless Four, Treacherous Three, and the Beastie Boys. Santoro and Lynch would plan shows with the rappers as well—Lynch organized the musical entertainment for the anti-apartheid protest of 1985, featuring the Cold Crush Brothers and Run-DMC. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I think it brought up a little awareness [to] hip hop and a little bit of awareness of us … to a different audience,” Caz said of the concert. </p> <div class="image width-left"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/7E3SYNFV25GDXOPTKXGY6HC5SQ.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text undefined"> Cold Crush Brothers performing at anti-apartheid protest. <span class="image-credit"> <br> Photo by Divonne Jarecki / Spectator Archives </span> </p> </div> <div class="image width-right"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/JXVPTEVJVBF35BKTR6LKRMPPZE.jpg"> <p class="image-caption-text undefined"> Cohen, Santoro and Run-DMC by Hamilton Hall. <span class="image-credit"> <br> Photo by Lori Traikos / Courtesy of Santoro </span> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> By 1985, hip-hop had started to gain a real foothold not just on Columbia’s campus, but across the city. Rap songs started showing up more frequently on mainstream radio stations like KISS-FM, and Run-DMC dropped two albums, “King of Rock” and “Raising Hell,” which would become the first hip-hop records to receive platinum certification. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> As for Santoro, Lynch, Cohen, and their collaborators at WKCR and CTV, many of them stayed in the world of music. Grau went on to co-found her own publishing company, Spiegel & Grau, under Penguin Random House, which has published numerous hip-hop-related books including Jay-Z’s “Decoded.”<i> </i>Wentz now operates her own music licensing company, Seven Seas Music. And Cohen now works as YouTube’s global head of music. Though they have all made their mark on the music industry in various ways, their role in hip-hop’s early rise was more as supporters than as trendsetters. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Ovid had a passion for music; I had a passion for exploration,” Cohen said. “I’m not convinced we did anything in particular,” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In the decade that followed, hip-hop would build on the momentum of the early-to mid-80s. The late ’80s into the ’90s has been referred to by hip-hop fans and scholars alike as the golden age. In this period, the sound diversified significantly, with East and West Coast rappers finding their own lanes in the rapidly evolving industry. Hip-hop’s commercial appeal was gaining traction as well, with Def Jam Recordings gaining massive popularity and a slew of hip-hop artists <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/03/labels/">joining new and established record labels</a>. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The ’90s also saw the beginning of hip-hop culture’s tread into other mediums, with rap stars like Will Smith, also known as the Fresh Prince, slowly becoming fixtures of American television screens. However, radio was still the primary agent through which hip-hop artists could connect with their growing market, and WKCR was still there to lend a hand. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> WKCR introduced a dedicated hip-hop show titled “<a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.40102/title.stretch-and-bobbito-speak-on-the-greatest-hip-hop-radio-show-ever-their-own">We Could Do This Show</a>,” hosted by renowned hip-hop DJs Clark Kent and Richie Rich in 1986. Their show ran until 1988, soon followed by the <a href="https://stretchandbobbito.com/film">most revered underground hip-hop radio shows</a> of the time. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Hosted by Adrian “Stretch Armstrong” Bartos, CC ’94, and Roberto “Bobbito” Garcia, “The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show” ran from 1990 to 1998 during the “Transfigured Night” time slot. It heavily featured many of the ’90s’ legendary artists before they were signed to major labels. From Jean Grae and Big L to Nas and Jay-Z, many of hip-hop’s most culturally significant figures came to the studio to grace the mic with unreleased verses and off-the-dome freestyles. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Though Stretch and Bobbito were relatively unconcerned with Columbia’s musical culture, they made their mark on the city at large. The show became a proving ground for local hip-hop artists, and groups as the Wu-Tang Clan were discovered by record label A&Rs through it. Others, like the Fugees, used the show to gain increased credibility among their fanbase. Their 2015 documentary, “Stretch and Bobbito: Radio That Changed Lives,” further explores their individual stories and their impact on hip-hop music and culture. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> As for its impact at Columbia, WKCR currently has two dedicated hip-hop shows: “Notes from the Underground,” hosted by Angelo Hernandez-Sias, CC ’20, and “Offbeat,” hosted by Damon Clark, CC ‘19, and Kiki Feliz. Currently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Offbeat is not currently on the air. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Between Santoro’s “Transfigured Night”<i> </i>show and “Alternate Currents”<i> </i>in the ’80s, and “The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show”<i> </i>in the ’90s, early hip-hop artists and Columbia students were able to create a centralized hub of activity for hip-hop culture and broadcast it to a large audience. This was crucial at a time when media exposure for emerging Black music was comparatively sparse. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> However, as hip-hop music and culture grew in popularity, so too did its ambitions. No longer complacent with being resigned to the underground, hip-hop would soon assert itself in the mainstream culture. </p> </div> <div class="footer g-body"> <div class="article-credits"> <p> Produced with <a href="https://github.com/graphicsdesk/spectate">Spectate</a> by the <a href="https://graphicsdesk.github.io">Spectator Graphics</a> team. </p> </div> </div> <script src="https://spectator-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/hip-hop-project/script.75da7f30.js"></script> </div> </body></html>
