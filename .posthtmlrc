Over the past 20 years, scores of hip-hop performers have touched down on Columbia’s campus, ranging from golden age stars like Snoop Dogg and Ghostface Killah to relatively recent artists like Kanye West and Talib Kweli. In 2001, Raw Elementz, Columbia’s oldest hip-hop dance crew, was founded. Spectator archives contains 370 mentions of hip-hop between the years 2000 and 2009 compared to 159 mentions during the 1990s and only five during the 1980s. Clearly, Columbia students were eager to embrace the culture and some were ready to engage with it directly, both in and out of the classroom."
